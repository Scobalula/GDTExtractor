# GDTExtractor

GDTExtractor is a simple tool that takes in a gdt file from Call of Duty: Black Ops III and extracts the assets to a folder for easy distribution. It also supports sound alias files. This tool was written over 4 years ago and is pretty primitive, it only supports xmodels, xanims, images, and sound alias csvs and doesn't attempt to resolve links. I figured since it's been shared around and has some use to others I might as well release it.

I am currently working a much better version that can take in map files, etc. and process directly from the gdt database with dependency resolving, etc. Stay tuned.

# Usage

To use simply drag and drop gdt/sound csv file/s onto the tool.
